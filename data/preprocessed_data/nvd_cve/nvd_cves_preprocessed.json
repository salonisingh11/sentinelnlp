    "description": "in the linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved ext4 fix oob read when checking dotdot dir mounting a corrupted filesystem with directory which contains '.' dir entry with reclen  block size results in out-of-bounds read later on, when the corrupted directory is removed. ext4emptydir assumes every ext4 directory contains at least '.' and '..' as directory entries in the first data block. it first loads the '.' dir entry, performs sanity checks by calling ext4checkdirentry and then uses its reclen member to compute the location of '..' dir entry in ext4nextentry. it assumes the '..' dir entry fits into the same data block. if the reclen of '.' is precisely one block 4kb, it slips through the sanity checks it is considered the last directory entry in the data block and leaves struct ext4direntry2 de point exactly past the memory slot allocated to the data block. the following call to ext4checkdirentry on new value of de then dereferences this pointer which results in out-of-bounds mem access. fix this by extending ext4checkdirentry to check for '.' dir entries that reach the end of data block. make sure to ignore the phony dir entries for checksum by checking namelen for non-zero. note this is reported by kasan as use-after-free in case another structure was recently freed from the slot past the bound, but it is really an oob read. this issue was found by syzkaller tool. call trace  38.594108 bug kasan slab-use-after-free in ext4checkdirentry0x67e0x710  38.594649 read of size 2 at addr ffff88802b41a004 by task syz-executor5375  38.595158  38.595288 cpu 0 uid 0 pid 5375 comm syz-executor not tainted 6.14.0-rc7 1  38.595298 hardware name qemu standard pc i440fx  piix, 1996, bios rel-1.16.3-0-ga6ed6b701f0a-prebuilt.qemu.org 04012014  38.595304 call trace  38.595308 task  38.595311 dumpstacklvl0xa70xd0  38.595325 printaddressdescription.constprop.00x2c0x3f0  38.595339 ? ext4checkdirentry0x67e0x710  38.595349 printreport0xaa0x250  38.595359 ? ext4checkdirentry0x67e0x710  38.595368 ? kasanaddrtoslab0x90x90  38.595378 kasanreport0xab0xe0  38.595389 ? ext4checkdirentry0x67e0x710  38.595400 ext4checkdirentry0x67e0x710  38.595410 ext4emptydir0x4650x990  38.595421 ? pfxext4emptydir0x100x10  38.595432 ext4rmdir.part.00x29a0xd10  38.595441 ? dquotinitialize0x2a70xbf0  38.595455 ? pfxext4rmdir.part.00x100x10  38.595464 ? pfxdquotinitialize0x100x10  38.595478 ? downwrite0xdb0x140  38.595487 ? pfxdownwrite0x100x10  38.595497 ext4rmdir0xee0x140  38.595506 vfsrmdir0x2090x670  38.595517 ? lookuponeqstrexcl0x3b0x190  38.595529 dormdir0x3630x3c0  38.595537 ? pfxdormdir0x100x10  38.595544 ? strncpyfromuser0x1ff0x2e0  38.595561 x64sysunlinkat0xf00x130  38.595570 dosyscall640x5b0x180  38.595583 entrysyscall64afterhwframe0x760x7e",

    "description": "in the linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved vhost-scsi fix handling of multiple calls to vhostscsisetendpoint if vhostscsisetendpoint is called multiple times without a vhostscsiclearendpoint between them, we can hit multiple bugs found by haoran zhang 1. use-after-free when no tpgs are found this fixes a use after free that occurs when vhostscsisetendpoint is called more than once and calls after the first call do not find any tpgs to add to the vstpg. when vhostscsisetendpoint first finds tpgs to add to the vstpg array matchtrue, so we will do vhostvqsetbackendvq, vstpg ... kfreevs-vstpg vs-vstpg  vstpg if vhostscsisetendpoint is called again and no tpgs are found matchfalse so we skip the vhostvqsetbackend call leaving the pointer to the vstpg we then free via kfreevs-vstpg vs-vstpg  vstpg if a scsi request is then sent we do vhostscsihandlevq - vhostscsigetreq - vhostvqgetbackend which sees the vstpg we just did a kfree on. 2. tpg dir removal hang this patch fixes an issue where we cannot remove a liotarget layer tpg and structs above it like the target dir due to the refcount dropping to -1. the problem is that if vhostscsisetendpoint detects a tpg is already in the vs-vstpg array or if the tpg has been removed so targetdependitem fails, the undepend goto handler will do targetundependitem on all tpgs in the vstpg array dropping their refcount to 0. at this time vstpg contains both the tpgs we have added in the current vhostscsisetendpoint call as well as tpgs we added in previous calls which are also in vs-vstpg. later, when vhostscsiclearendpoint runs it will do targetundependitem on all the tpgs in the vs-vstpg which will drop their refcount to -1. userspace will then not be able to remove the tpg and will hang when it tries to do rmdir on the tpg dir. 3. tpg leak this fixes a bug where we can leak tpgs and cause them to be un-removable because the target name is overwritten when vhostscsisetendpoint is called multiple times but with different target names. the bug occurs if a user has called vhostscsisetendpoint and setup a vhost-scsi device to targettpg mapping, then calls vhostscsisetendpoint again with a new target name that has tpgs we haven't seen before target1 has tpg1 but target2 has tpg2. when this happens we don't teardown the old target tpg mapping and just overwrite the target name and the vs-vstpg array. later when we do vhostscsiclearendpoint, we are passed in either target1 or target2's name and we will only match that target's tpgs when we loop over the vs-vstpg. we will then return from the function without doing targetundependitem on the tpgs. because of all these bugs, it looks like being able to call vhostscsisetendpoint multiple times was never supported. the major user, qemu, already has checks to prevent this use case. so to fix the issues, this patch prevents vhostscsisetendpoint from being called if it's already successfully added tpgs. to add, remove or change the tpg config or target name, you must do a vhostscsiclearendpoint first.",

    "description": "in the linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved udp fix memory accounting leak. matt dowling reported a weird udp memory usage issue. under normal operation, the udp memory usage reported in procnetsockstat remains close to zero. however, it occasionally spiked to 524,288 pages and never dropped. moreover, the value doubled when the application was terminated. finally, it caused intermittent packet drops. we can reproduce the issue with the script below 0 1. procnetsockstat reports 0 pages  cat procnetsockstat  grep udp udp inuse 1 mem 0 2. run the script till the report reaches 524,288  python3 test.py  sleep 5  cat procnetsockstat  grep udp udp inuse 3 mem 524288 -- intmax  1  pageshift 3. kill the socket and confirm the number never drops  pkill python3  sleep 5  cat procnetsockstat  grep udp udp inuse 1 mem 524288 4. necessary since v6.0 trigger protomemorypcpudrain  python3 test.py  sleep 1  pkill python3 5. the number doubles  cat procnetsockstat  grep udp udp inuse 1 mem 1048577 the application set intmax to sorcvbuf, which triggered an integer overflow in udprmemrelease. when a socket is closed, udpdestructcommon purges its receive queue and sums up skb-truesize in the queue. this total is calculated and stored in a local unsigned integer variable. the total size is then passed to udprmemrelease to adjust memory accounting. however, because the function takes a signed integer argument, the total size can wrap around, causing an overflow. then, the released amount is calculated as follows 1 add size to sk-skforwardalloc. 2 round down sk-skforwardalloc to the nearest lower multiple of pagesize and assign it to amount. 3 subtract amount from sk-skforwardalloc. 4 pass amount  pageshift to skmemreduceallocated. when the issue occurred, the total in udpdestructcommon was 2147484480 intmax  833, which was cast to -2147482816 in udprmemrelease. at 1 sk-skforwardalloc is changed from 3264 to -2147479552, and 2 sets -2147479552 to amount. 3 reverts the wraparound, so we don't see a warning in inetsockdestruct. however, udpmemoryallocated ends up doubling at 4. since commit 3cd3399dd7a8 net implement per-cpu reserves for memoryallocated, memory usage no longer doubles immediately after a socket is closed because skmemreduceallocated caches the amount in udpmemorypercpufwalloc. however, the next time a udp socket receives a packet, the subtraction takes effect, causing udp memory usage to double. this issue makes further memory allocation fail once the socket's sk-skrmemalloc exceeds net.ipv4.udprmemmin, resulting in packet drops. to prevent this issue, let's use unsigned int for the calculation and call skforwardallocadd only once for the small delta. note that firstpacketlength also potentially has the same problem. 0 from socket import  sorcvbufforce  33 intmax  2  31 - 1 s  socketafinet, sockdgram s.bind'', 0 s.setsockoptsolsocket, sorcvbufforce, intmax c  socketafinet, sockdgram c.connects.getsockname data  b'a'  100 while true c.senddata",

    "description": "jellyfin is an open source self hosted media server. versions before 10.10.7 are vulnerable to argument injection in ffmpeg. this can be leveraged to possibly achieve remote code execution by anyone with credentials to a low-privileged user. this vulnerability was previously reported in cve-2023-49096 and patched in version 10.8.13, but the patch can be bypassed. the original fix sanitizes some parameters to make injection impossible, but certain unsanitized parameters can still be used for argument injection. the same unauthenticated endpoints are vulnerable videositemidstream and videositemidstream.container, likely alongside similar endpoints in audiocontroller. this argument injection can be exploited to achieve arbitrary file write, leading to possible remote code execution through the plugin system. while the unauthenticated endpoints are vulnerable, a valid itemid is required for exploitation and any authenticated attacker could easily retrieve a valid itemid to make the exploit work. this vulnerability is patched in version 10.10.7.",

    "description": "in the linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mmsecretmem fix panic when growing a memfdsecret when one tries to grow an existing memfdsecret with ftruncate, one gets a panic 1. for example, doing the following reliably induces the panic fd  memfdsecret ftruncatefd, 10 ptr  mmapnull, 10, protread  protwrite, mapshared, fd, 0 strcpyptr, 123456789 munmapptr, 10 ftruncatefd, 20 the basic reason for this is, when we grow with ftruncate, we call down into simplesetattr, and then truncateinodepagesrange, and eventually we try to zero part of the memory. the normal truncation code does this via the direct map i.e., it calls pageaddress and hands that to memset. for memfdsecret though, we specifically don't map our pages via the direct map i.e. we call setdirectmapinvalidnoflush on every fault. so the address returned by pageaddress isn't useful, and when we try to memset with it we panic. this patch avoids the panic by implementing a custom setattr for memfdsecret, which detects resizes specifically setting the size for the first time works just fine, since there are no existing pages to try to zero, and rejects them with einval. one could argue growing should be supported, but i think that will require a significantly more lengthy change. so, i propose a minimal fix for the benefit of stable kernels, and then perhaps to extend memfdsecret to support growing in a separate patch. 1 bug unable to handle page fault for address ffffa0a889277028 pf supervisor write access in kernel mode pf errorcode0x0002 - not-present page pgd afa01067 p4d afa01067 pud 83f909067 pmd 83f8bf067 pte 800ffffef6d88060 oops 0002 1 preempt smp debugpagealloc pti cpu 0 pid 281 comm repro not tainted 5.17.0-dbg-dev 1 hardware name qemu standard pc i440fx  piix, 1996, bios 1.15.0-1 04012014 rip 0010memseterms0x90x10 code c1 e9 03 40 0f b6 f6 48 b8 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 48 0f af c6 f3 48 ab 89 d1 f3 aa 4c 89 c8 c3 90 49 89 f9 40 88 f0 48 89 d1 f3 aa 4c 89 c8 c3 90 49 89 fa 40 0f b6 ce 48 b8 01 01 01 01 01 01 rsp 0018ffffb932c09afbf0 eflags 00010246 rax 0000000000000000 rbx ffffda63c4249dc0 rcx 0000000000000fd8 rdx 0000000000000fd8 rsi 0000000000000000 rdi ffffa0a889277028 rbp ffffb932c09afc00 r08 0000000000001000 r09 ffffa0a889277028 r10 0000000000020023 r11 0000000000000000 r12 ffffda63c4249dc0 r13 ffffa0a890d70d98 r14 0000000000000028 r15 0000000000000fd8 fs 00007f72948995800000 gsffffa0af9bc000000000 knlgs0000000000000000 cs 0010 ds 0000 es 0000 cr0 0000000080050033 cr2 ffffa0a889277028 cr3 0000000107ef6006 cr4 0000000000370ef0 dr0 0000000000000000 dr1 0000000000000000 dr2 0000000000000000 dr3 0000000000000000 dr6 00000000fffe0ff0 dr7 0000000000000400 call trace ? zerousersegments0x820x190 truncateinodepartialfolio0xd40x2a0 truncateinodepagesrange0x3800x830 truncatesetsize0x630x80 simplesetattr0x370x60 notifychange0x3d80x4d0 dosysftruncate0x1620x1d0 x64sysftruncate0x1c0x20 dosyscall640x440xa0 entrysyscall64afterhwframe0x440xae modules linked in xhcipci xhcihcd virtionet netfailover failover virtioblk virtioballoon uhcihcd ohcipci ohcihcd evdev ehcipci ehcihcd 9pnetvirtio 9p netfs 9pnet cr2 ffffa0a889277028 lkpintel.com secretmemiops can be static axelrasmussengoogle.com return einval",

    "description": "in the linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm zswap properly synchronize freeing resources during cpu hotunplug in zswapcompress and zswapdecompress, the per-cpu acompctx of the current cpu at the beginning of the operation is retrieved and used throughout. however, since neither preemption nor migration are disabled, it is possible that the operation continues on a different cpu. if the original cpu is hotunplugged while the acompctx is still in use, we run into a uaf bug as some of the resources attached to the acompctx are freed during hotunplug in zswapcpucompdead i.e. acompctx.buffer, acompctx.req, or acompctx.acomp. the problem was introduced in commit 1ec3b5fe6eec mmzswap move to use cryptoacomp api for hardware acceleration when the switch to the cryptoacomp api was made. prior to that, the per-cpu cryptocomp was retrieved using getcpuptr which disables preemption and makes sure the cpu cannot go away from under us. preemption cannot be disabled with the cryptoacomp api as a sleepable context is needed. use the acompctx.mutex to synchronize cpu hotplug callbacks allocating and freeing resources with compressiondecompression paths. make sure that acompctx.req is null when the resources are freed. in the compressiondecompression paths, check if acompctx.req is null after acquiring the mutex meaning the cpu was offlined and retry on the new cpu. the initialization of acompctx.mutex is moved from the cpu hotplug callback to the pool initialization where it belongs where the mutex is allocated. in addition to adding clarity, this makes sure that cpu hotplug cannot reinitialize a mutex that is already locked by compressiondecompression. previously a fix was attempted by holding cpusreadlock 1. this would have caused a potential deadlock as it is possible for code already holding the lock to fall into reclaim and enter zswap causing a deadlock. a fix was also attempted using srcu for synchronization, but johannes pointed out that synchronizesrcu cannot be used in cpu hotplug notifiers 2. alternative fixes that were consideredattempted and could have worked - refcounting the per-cpu acompctx. this involves complexity in handling the race between the refcount dropping to zero in zswapdecompress and the refcount being re-initialized when the cpu is onlined. - disabling migration before getting the per-cpu acompctx 3, but that's discouraged and is a much bigger hammer than needed, and could result in subtle performance issues. 1 2 3 yosryahmedgoogle.com remove comment",

    "description": "in the linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mm shmem fix getting incorrect lruvec when replacing a shmem folio when testing shmem swapin, i encountered the warning below on my machine. the reason is that replacing an old shmem folio with a new one causes memcgroupmigrate to clear the old folio's memcg data. as a result, the old folio cannot get the correct memcg's lruvec needed to remove itself from the lru list when it is being freed. this could lead to possible serious problems, such as lru list crashes due to holding the wrong lru lock, and incorrect lru statistics. to fix this issue, we can fallback to use the memcgroupreplacefolio to replace the old shmem folio.  5241.100311 page refcount0 mapcount0 mapping0000000000000000 index0x0 pfn0x5d9960  5241.100317 head order4 mapcount0 entiremapcount0 nrpagesmapped0 pincount0  5241.100319 flags 0x17fffe0000040068uptodatelruheadswapbackednode0zone2lastcpupid0x3ffff  5241.100323 raw 17fffe0000040068 fffffdffd6687948 fffffdffd69ae008 0000000000000000  5241.100325 raw 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 00000000ffffffff 0000000000000000  5241.100326 head 17fffe0000040068 fffffdffd6687948 fffffdffd69ae008 0000000000000000  5241.100327 head 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 00000000ffffffff 0000000000000000  5241.100328 head 17fffe0000000204 fffffdffd6665801 ffffffffffffffff 0000000000000000  5241.100329 head 0000000a00000010 0000000000000000 00000000ffffffff 0000000000000000  5241.100330 page dumped because vmwarnononcefolio!memcg  !memcgroupdisabled  5241.100338 ------------ cut here ------------  5241.100339 warning cpu 19 pid 78402 at includelinuxmemcontrol.h775 foliolruveclockirqsave0x1400x150 ...  5241.100374 pc  foliolruveclockirqsave0x1400x150  5241.100375 lr  foliolruveclockirqsave0x1380x150  5241.100376 sp  ffff80008b38b930 ...  5241.100398 call trace  5241.100399 foliolruveclockirqsave0x1400x150  5241.100401 pagecacherelease0x900x300  5241.100404 folioput0x500x108  5241.100406 shmemreplacefolio0x1b40x240  5241.100409 shmemswapinfolio0x3140x528  5241.100411 shmemgetfoliogfp0x3b40x930  5241.100412 shmemfault0x740x160  5241.100414 dofault0x400x218  5241.100417 dosharedfault0x340x1b0  5241.100419 dofault0x400x168  5241.100420 handleptefault0x800x228  5241.100422 handlemmfault0x1c40x440  5241.100424 handlemmfault0x600x1f0  5241.100426 dopagefault0x1200x488  5241.100429 dotranslationfault0x4c0x68  5241.100431 domemabort0x480xa0  5241.100434 el0da0x380xc0  5241.100436 el0t64synchandler0x680xc0  5241.100437 el0t64sync0x14c0x150  5241.100439 --- end trace 0000000000000000 --- baolin.wanglinux.alibaba.com remove less helpful comments, per matthew",

    "description": "in the linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved mmswap fix race when skipping swapcache when skipping swapcache for swpsynchronousio, if two or more threads swapin the same entry at the same time, they get different pages a, b. before one thread t0 finishes the swapin and installs page a to the pte, another thread t1 could finish swapin of page b, swapfree the entry, then swap out the possibly modified page reusing the same entry. it breaks the ptesame check in t0 because pte value is unchanged, causing aba problem. thread t0 will install a stalled page a into the pte and cause data corruption. one possible callstack is like this cpu0 cpu1 ---- ---- doswappage doswappage with same entry direct swapin path direct swapin path alloc page a alloc page b swapreadfolio - read to page a swapreadfolio - read to page b slow on later locks or interrupt finished swapin first ... setpteat swapfree - entry is free write to page b, now page a stalled swap out page b to same swap entry ptesame - check pass, pte seems unchanged, but page a is stalled! swapfree - page b content lost! setpteat - staled page a installed! and besides, for zram, swapfree allows the swap device to discard the entry content, so even if page b is not modified, if swapreadfolio on cpu0 happens later than swapfree on cpu1, it may also cause data loss. to fix this, reuse swapcacheprepare which will pin the swap entry using the cache flag, and allow only one thread to swap it in, also prevent any parallel code from putting the entry in the cache. release the pin after pt unlocked. racers just loop and wait since it's a rare and very short event. a scheduletimeoutuninterruptible1 call is added to avoid repeated page faults wasting too much cpu, causing livelock or adding too much noise to perf statistics. a similar livelock issue was described in commit 029c4628b2eb mm swap get rid of livelock in swapin readahead reproducer this race issue can be triggered easily using a well constructed reproducer and patched brd with a delay in read path 1 with latest 6.8 mainline, race caused data loss can be observed easily  gcc -g -lpthread test-thread-swap-race.c  .a.out polulating 32mb of memory region... keep swapping out... starting round 0... spawning 65536 workers... 32746 workers spawned, wait for done... round 0 error on 0x5aa00, expected 32746, got 32743, 3 data loss! round 0 error on 0x395200, expected 32746, got 32743, 3 data loss! round 0 error on 0x3fd000, expected 32746, got 32737, 9 data loss! round 0 failed, 15 data loss! this reproducer spawns multiple threads sharing the same memory region using a small swap device. every two threads updates mapped pages one by one in opposite direction trying to create a race, with one dedicated thread keep swapping out the data out using madvise. the reproducer created a reproduce rate of about once every 5 minutes, so the race should be totally possible in production. after this patch, i ran the reproducer for over a few hundred rounds and no data loss observed. performance overhead is minimal, microbenchmark swapin 10g from 32g zram before 10934698 us after 11157121 us cached 13155355 us dropping swpsynchronousio flag kasongtencent.com v4",
