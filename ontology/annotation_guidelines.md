# Annotation Guidelines v1.0 ‚Äî Cyber Threat Intelligence

These guidelines are for annotating entities and relationships in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports. The goal is to create high-quality training data for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction.

## üß† Entity Types

| Entity Type    | Examples                             | Description                                         |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|

| MALWARE        | Emotet, WannaCry                     | Malware families or specific threats               |
| TOOL           | Mimikatz, Cobalt Strike              | Tools used during attacks (open source or illicit) |
| VULNERABILITY  | CVE-2021-34527, BlueKeep             | Vulnerabilities exploited by attackers             |

## ‚úÖ Annotation Rules

- Annotate **whole entity names** (e.g., ‚ÄúAPT29 Group‚Äù not just ‚ÄúAPT29‚Äù).
- Annotate **first valid instance** in each paragraph or sentence.
- Use **CVE IDs** when mentioned (CVE-2020-0601, etc.).
- Link TECHNIQUES only to correct TACTICS based on MITRE ATT&CK.
- Annotate IPs/Domains **only if** clearly related to attacker infrastructure.
- Avoid casual references unless tied to an attack context.
- Do not annotate overlapping entities unless nested meaningfully.

## üì¶ Output Format Example (for annotation)

```json
{
  "text": "APT29 used Mimikatz to escalate privileges via DLL Sideloading.",
  "entities": [
    {"start": 0, "end": 5, "label": "THREAT_ACTOR"},
    {"start": 11, "end": 19, "label": "TOOL"},
    {"start": 47, "end": 64, "label": "TECHNIQUE"}
  ],
  "relations": [
    {"source": 0, "target": 1, "type": "uses"},
    {"source": 1, "target": 2, "type": "facilitates"}
  ]
}
