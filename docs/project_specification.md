# SentinelNLP Project Specification

## Project Overview

The SentinelNLP project is an Ontology-Based NLP Framework for Cyber Threat Knowledge Representation. It aims to extract, structure, and represent cybersecurity knowledge from unstructured text using natural language processing techniques and ontology-based knowledge representation.

### Problem Statement

The cybersecurity domain faces challenges in processing and utilizing the vast amount of unstructured textual information available:

1. **Information Overload**: Security analysts face an overwhelming volume of text (threat reports, vulnerability descriptions, advisories)
2. **Disconnected Knowledge**: Related information exists in separate sources without clear connections
3. **Manual Processing**: Extraction of entities and relationships from text is largely manual
4. **Limited Standardization**: Different sources use inconsistent terminology and structures
5. **Complex Queries**: Finding specific information across multiple sources is difficult

### Solution Approach

SentinelNLP addresses these challenges through:

1. **Automated NLP**: Extract entities and relationships from cybersecurity text automatically
2. **Ontology Structure**: Provide a formal representation of cybersecurity domain knowledge
3. **Knowledge Graph**: Build a connected repository of cybersecurity entities and relationships
4. **Standardized Representation**: Align with industry standards like STIX and MITRE ATT&CK
5. **Query Interface**: Enable complex queries across the knowledge graph

## Architectural Design

### System Components

The SentinelNLP framework consists of five primary components:
